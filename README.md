## 🤖 AI Assistant

The application includes a built-in `CRM AI` workspace for natural-language analysis of CRM data.

Key capabilities:

- Ask business questions about clients, orders, invoices, payments, and sales performance
- Respect the current user's data access permissions and keep conversations private to their author
- Use built-in business reports such as `Client 360 Report` and `Category Cashflow Risk Allocation Report`
- Keep the conversation history with automatically generated chat titles
- Upload files to the conversation and let the assistant analyze supported documents and images
- Generate interactive links to CRM records directly in responses

Configuration:

- Set `spring.ai.openai.api-key` in [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) or provide the `SPRING_AI_OPENAI_APIKEY` environment variable

When enabled, open the `CRM AI` item in the main menu to start a new conversation.

## 🎲 Demo Data

The local profile generates demo data on the application start:

- You can disable demo data generation with `crm.generateDemoData` property
  in [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties)
- Catalog imported from [catalog.xlsx](src/main/resources/demo-data/catalog.xlsx)
