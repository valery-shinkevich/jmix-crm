    - Manage product catalog (Categories and Category Items).
    - Assign Account Managers to Clients.
- `Manager`: Primary role for sales operations.
    - Full access to Clients, Contacts, Orders, Invoices, and Payments.
    - Read-only access to the product catalog.
    - Manage own Tasks.
- `UI Minimal`: Minimal access, allowing login and basic navigation.
